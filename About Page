<p>
Our Cookbook website provides users with recipes, cooking instructions, and calories pertaining to those recipes. 
Users will be able to input ingredients of their choice on the website search page. Our website will then provide the 
user with multiple recipes that can be made from the inputted ingredients, as well as cooking instructions, and calorie 
count. This search feature can be accessed by anyone, even if they do not have a website account. Our website will also 
allow users to save recipes so they can view them whenever they like. This feature will only be available to those that 
have a website account. Knowing what food to make based on what we have home can be time consuming. Some people may not 
know what to make and end up going out and buying food/groceries because they are unaware of what recipes they can make. 
Our website will help users save time and money.
