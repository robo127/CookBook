<p>
The purpose of our Cookbook website is to provide users with recipes, cooking instructions, and calories pertaining
to those recipes. Once logged in, users will be able to input ingredients of their choice on the website
search page. Our website will then provide the user with multiple recipes that can be made from the inputted
ingredients, as well as cooking instructions, and caloric count. Knowing what food to make based on what we have
home can be time consuming. Some people may not know what to make and end up going out and buying food/groceries
because they are unaware of what recipes they can make. Our website will help users save time and money.
